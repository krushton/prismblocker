<h2>Prism Blocker</h2>

Chrome* extension that redirects any requests to a URL owned by a Prism company to eff.org instead.

This includes all URLs I could identify as belonging to Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, Dropbox, Apple, or Facebook.

Install through the Extensions panel in Chrome (use 'Load Unpacked Extension').
